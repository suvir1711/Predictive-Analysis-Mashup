# Streamlit Mashup Web App

This Streamlit-based web application enables users to generate music mashups effortlessly. Users have the option to input the name of a singer, specify the desired number of videos, set the duration for audio clips, and provide their email address. Once submitted, the app initiates the Mashup process, generates a zip file containing the resultant mashup, and dispatches it to the user's provided email address.
